## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I really enjoyed working with on this project beacause I got to work alot with CSS Grid which was really fun to do.

You can see the code snippet below;

```css
.testimonial_grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

Placing the background image was also soemthing I enjoyed doing as I learnt how to use the background-position property at the right spot at the top 10% away from the right.

```css
.Daniel {
  background-color: var(--moderate-violet);
  background-image: url(../images/bg-pattern-quotation.svg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: top right 10%;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep doing more projects to improve my HTML and CSS.
